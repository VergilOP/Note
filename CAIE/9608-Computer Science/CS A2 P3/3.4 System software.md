3.4 System software
-------------------

### ***3.4.1 Purposes of an operating system (OS)***

> show understanding of how an OS can maximise the use of resources
---

> describe the ways in which the user interface hides the complexities of the hardware from the
user
---

> show understanding of processor management: multitasking, including:
> - the concept of multitasking and a process
> - the process states: running, ready and blocked
> - the need for scheduling
> - the concept of an interrupt
> - how the kernel of the OS acts as the interrupt handler and how interrupt handling is used to
manage low-level scheduling
---

#### Explain why an operating system needs to use `scheduling algorithms` \[3\]
> w19_33_Q6

- To allow multiprogramming to take place
- To ensure fair usage of the processor
- To ensure fair usage of peripherals
- To ensure fair usage of memory
- To ensure higher priority tasks are executed sooner
- To ensure all processes have the opportunity to finish

#### What is meant by an `interrupt` \[1\]
> w19_33_Q6

- A **signal** from a software **source** or hardware device seeking the **attention of the processor**

> show understanding of paging for memory management: including:
> - the concepts of paging and virtual memory
> - the need for paging
> - how pages can be replaced
> - how disk thrashing can occur

#### What is meant by `Page` \[1\]
> w19_33_Q6

- Virtual Memory is divided into blocks of a fixed size

#### What is meant by `Page frame` \[1\]
> w19_33_Q6

- the main memory is divided into page frames of the same size as a page

#### What is meant by `Page table` \[1\]
> w19_33_Q6

- the Page table shows the mapping of pages to page frames

### ***3.4.2 Virtual machine***

> show understanding of the concept of a virtual machine
---

#### Complete the statements about a `virtual machine` \[4\]
> w20_33_Q5

- A virtual machine is ***Software/a program*** that emulates a ***Physical/different*** computer system
- A virtual machine allows multiple ***Guest*** operating systems to run on one computer using a ***Host*** operating system

> give examples of the role of virtual machines
---

> show understanding of the benefits and limitations of virtual machines
---

### ***3.4.3 Translation software***

> show understanding of how an interpreter can execute programs without producing a translated
version
---

> show understanding of the various stages in the compilation of a program: lexical analysis, syntax
analysis, code generation and optimisation
---

> show understanding of how the grammar of a language can be expressed using syntax diagrams
or Backus-Naur Form (BNF) notation
---

#### Explain how `RPN` is used by an interpreter to evaluate expressions. \[2\]
> s20_33_Q6

- Expressions are always evaluated left to right
- Each operator uses the two previous values on the stack
- Popping two previous values and pushing the new value on the previous value

> show understanding of how Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) can be used to carry out the
evaluation of expressions
