Monitoring and Control systems
------------------------------

### Explain the importance of feedback in a control system \[3\]
> s19_33_Q6

- To ensure that the system operates within the given criteria
- By enabling system output to affect subsequent system inputs
- Thus enabling the system to automatically adjust conditions
- Suitable example of feedback

### Describe the use of feedback in this control system \[4\]
> s19_33_Q6

- Sensors continually measure the temperature of the water in the swimming pool
- The (stream of) readings are sent to a processor and compared with 28 degrees
- If the reading is out of range (by a system set amount) then actuators turn the heater/cooler on or off as necessary
