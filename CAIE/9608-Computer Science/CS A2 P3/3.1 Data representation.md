## 3.1 Data Representation
------------------------

### ***3.1.1 User-defined data types***

> **show understanding of `why user-defined types are necessary`**
---

#### Explain why `user-defined date types` are necessary \[2\]
> w19_33_Q5

- No suitable data type is provided by the language used
- The programmer needs specify a new data type
- ...that meets the requirements of the application

> define and use `non-composite types`: enumerated, point
---

> define and use `composite data types`: set, record and class/object
---

#### State **two** other `composite data types` \[2\]
> w19_33_Q5

- Array
- List
- Set
- Collection
- Class
- Stack
- Queue
- Linked list
- Dictionary

> `choose and design an appropriate user-defined data type` for a given problem
---

### ***3.1.2 File organisation and access***

> show understanding of methods of `file organisation`: serial, sequential (using a key) file random (using a record key)
---

#### `File organisation`
> s20_33_Q2

- Sequential: Master file for paying each employee every month
- Random: Customer username and password file
- Serial: Text file, File for recording the temperature every hour

> show understanding of methods of `file access`:
> - sequential access for serial and sequential files
> - direct access for sequential and random files
---

> `select an appropriate method` of file organisation and file access for a given problem
---

### ***3.1.3 Real numbers and normalised floating-point representation***

> describe the `format of binary floating-point real numbers`
---

> convert binary floating-point real numbers `into denary` and vice versa
---

> `normalise` floating-point numbers
---

> show understanding of the reasons for normalisation
---

#### Describe one problem that can occur when `floating-point numbers` are not `normalised` \[2\]
> w20_33_Q1

- Precision lost
- Redundant leading zeros in the mantissa
- Bits lost off right-hand end
- Multiple representations of a single number

> show understanding of the effects of changing the allocation of bits to `mantissa and exponent` in a floating-point representation
---

#### Explain the trade-off between using either a large number of bits for the `mantiss`, or a large number of bits for the `exponent` \[3\]
> s19_33_Q1

- The trade-off is between range and precision
- Any increase in the number of bits for the mantissa, means fewer bits available for the exponent
- More bits used for the mantissa will result in better precision
- More bits used for the exponent will result in a large range of numbers
- Fewer bits used for the mantissa will result in worse precision
- Fewer bits used for the exponent will result in a smaller range of numbers

#### Explain why ... cannot be accurately represented when increasing `Mantissa` and decreasing `Exponent` \[3\]
> s20_33_Q1

- Exponent too large to fit in ... bits as a two's complement number
- Exponent will turn negative
- ...therefore, point moves the wrong way
- Value will be approx ...

#### State the effect of increasing the size of the `exponent` \[1\]
> w19_33_Q1

- Only the range is increased/no effect on precision

> show understanding of how `underflow` and `overflow` can occur
---

#### What is `Overflow` \[1\]
> w19_33_Q1

- ***Overflow*** can occur in the exponent of a floating-point number, when the exponent has become too large to be represented using the number of bits available.

#### What is `Underflow` \[1\]
> w19_33_Q1

- A calculation results in a number so small that is cannot be represented by the number of bits available. This is called ***Underflow***.

> show understanding of the consequences of a binary representation only being `an approximation
to the real number` it represents (in certain cases)
---

> show understanding that binary representations can give rise to `rounding errors`
---
#### State why some `binary representations` can lead to rounding errors \[1\]
> w19_33_Q1

- There is no exact binary conversion for some numbers
- More bits are needed to store the number than are available
