## Q1 Planning \[15\]

### Defining the problem \[2\]

- Identify `the independent and dependent variable` in the experiment \[1\]
- Identify the variables that are to be kept `constant` \[1\]

### Methods of data collection \[4\]

- Describe, `with the diagram`, the arrangement of experiment \[1\]
- Describe the method to be used to `vary the independent variable` \[1\]
- Describe how the `independent variables` are to be measured \[1\]
- Describe how the `dependent variables` are to be measured \[1\]

### Method of analysis \[3\]

- `Plot` the graph \[1\]
- Describe the `y-intercept` \[1\]
- Describe the `gradient` \[1\]

### Additional detail including safety considerations \[6\]

- `safety consideration` \[1\]
- keep ... `constant` \[1\]
- `method` to keep ... constant \[1\]
- for same ... repeat experiment to `find average` ... \[1\]
- relationship `valid` if a straight line \[1\]
- use a `large` ... for ...  \[1\]

### Experiments Apparatus

- **Velocity at a point**: Light gates
- **Mass**: Balance
- **Sound**: Microphone, Sound meter, Sound detector
- **Pressure**: Bourdon gauge, U-Tube, Pump
- **Temperature**: Thermometer
- **Wavelength(light)**: Diffraction grating (nλ = dsinθ)/Young's slit(λ = aX/D)
- **Light Intensity**: Light meter / Detector, LDR
- **Power**: Ammeter, Voltmeter(P = IV)
- **Force**: Newton-meter, Extension of stretched elastic/spring
- **Magnetic Field Strength**: Hall probe
- **Electrical**: Variable resistor, LDR, Photocell
- **Wave**: C.R.O

## Q2 Analysis, conclusions and evaluation \[15\]

### Data analysis \[1\]

use the equation, and the unit  
\# be careful of the unit

### Table of result \[2\]

1. average value (be careful about the revolution)
2. uncertainty
   - if the value is **not lg/ln or fraction**, use percentage uncertainty
   - if the value is **lg/ln and fraction**, use the result of max and min
     - **e.g.**  
       say you are taking log of x...  
       now x is supposed 83 +/- 5...  
       log 83 = 1.92  
       so Upper Limit (UL) = 83 + 5 = 88  
       and lower limit (LL) = 83 - 5 = 78  
       error: \[log(UL) - log (LL)\]/2

### Graph \[6\]

1. show the error bar
2. plot the B.F. (best fit line)
3. plot the W.F. (worst fit line) using the `top of last`, and the `bottom of the first`(according to the question)
4. find two points to find the gradient of the B.F./W.F.
5. minus the gradients to calculate the uncertainty

***\# be careful of the unit***

### Conclusion \[6\]
