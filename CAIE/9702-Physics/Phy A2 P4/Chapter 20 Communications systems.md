Communication system
--------------------

### A `geostationary satellite` \[3\]
- orbits with a period of 24 hours
- move from west to east
- always above the Equator

### Why different frequencies are used for the `up-link`, and the `down-link` in communication with the satellite \[3\]
- up-link has been attenuated
- down-link signal must be amplified
- prevents down-link swamping up-link

### State three advantages of the use of an optic fibre rather than a wire pair \[3\]
> s20_42_Q5

- greater bandwidth
- less noise
- less attenuation/fewer repeaters
- less cross-linking/greater security

### Two advantages of the transmission of data in `digital form` \[2\]
> m20_42_Q5
- noise can be filtered
- can carry more information per unit time
- can have extra bits of data to check for errors
- can be encrypted

### The effect of `increasement of sampling rate` \[1\]
- The step width decreases

### The effect of `increasement of number of bits in each sample` \[1\]
- the step height increases
