Nuclear physics
---------------

### `The forms of energy` into which the energy is transformed in nuclear reaction \[2\]
- The internal energy/The kinetic energy/The potential energy
- Î³-ray photon energy

### Why a nucleus of helium-4 does `not spontaneously break down` to become nuclei of hydrogen \[2\]
> s20_42_Q12

- binding energy per nucleon is much greater
- so would require a large amount of energy to separate the nucleons in helium
