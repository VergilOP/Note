Quantum physics
---------------

### Why the spectrum contains a number of `dark lines` \[4\]
> s17_41_Q11

- electrons interact with photons
- photon energy causes electron to move to higher energy level
- photon energy = difference in energy of energy levels
- when electrons de-excite, photons emitted in all directions

### Why the `resistance of the copper wire` increases as its temperature increases. \[4\]
> s20_42_Q11

- conduction band and valence band overlap
- number density of charge carriers does not vary
- increase in temperature gives rise to increased lattice vibrations
- lattice vibrations hinder movement of charge carriers so resistance increase

### Why the `resistance of an intrinsic semiconductor material` decreases as its temperature increases \[4\]
> w19_42_Q10

- electrons in valence band gain energy
- electrons jump to conduction band
- holes are left in the valence band
- increased number of charge carriers causes lower resistance

### Explain why, for any particular wavelength of electromagnetic radiation, `most of the electrons are emitted with kinetic energies less than the maximum value E<sub>MAX</sub>` \[2\]
> m16_42_Q11

- maximum kinetic energy when electron emitted from surface
- energy is required to bring an electron to the surface

### The `wave nature` of a particle \[1\]
> w16_42_Q12

- electron diffraction
- electron microscope

### The `particle nature` of electromagnetic radiation \[1\]
> w16_42_Q12

- photoelectric effect
- Compton scattering

### Describe `two phenomenon` associated with the photoelectric effect that cannot be explained using `a wave theory` of light \[2\]
> s17_42_Q10

- frequency below which electrons not ejected
- maximum energy of electron depends on frequency
- maximum energy of electrons does not depend on intensity
- instantaneous emission of electrons
