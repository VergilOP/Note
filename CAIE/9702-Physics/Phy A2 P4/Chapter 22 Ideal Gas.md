### What is `seen through the microscope` in `Brownian motion` \[1\]
> w19_42_Q2

- specks of light moving haphazardly

### How `Brownian motion` `provides evidence` for the nature of the movement of gas molecules \[2\]
> w19_42_Q2

- random motion of the gas molecules
- causes the haphazard motion of the smoke particles

### Describe the `motion of molecules in a gas` \[2\]
- random/haphazard
- constant velocity/distribution of speeds/different direction

### State the `assumption` of the kinetic theory of the gases \[4\]

*Hint: 2 basic property*
- The molecules move randomly
- The collisions of the molecules are perfectly elastic

*Hint: 3 negligible*
- The volume of molecules is negligible
- The internal force between molecules is negligible
- The time of collisions is negligible

### Explain how each of the following terms in p = (1/3)ρ<c<sup>2</sup>>
> s20_42_Q2

#### ρ
- Nm/V

#### 1/3
- molecules move in three dimensions (not one) so 1/3 in any (one) direction

#### \<c<sup>2</sup>\>
- molecules have different speeds so take average
- of (speed)<sup>2</sup>

### Explain the change in the internal energy \[3\]
> s20_42_Q3

- Volume change/not change
- Thermal energy supplied to provide heat/Work against atmosphere
- internal energy increases/decreases
