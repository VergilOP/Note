Magnetic fields and electromagnetism
------------------------------------

### Explain why for a slice of the same dimensions with the same current and magnetic flux density, the Hall voltage produced in a semiconductor material is much larger. \[2\]
> s16_42_Q9

- V<sub>H</sub> is inversely proportional to n
- for semiconductors, n is (much) smaller than for metals

### Explain the difference, if any, that conduction by electrons or by holes will have on the Hall voltage \[3\]
> s16_42_Q9

- magnetic field would deflect holes and electrons in same direction
- because electrons are -ve, holes are +ve
- so V<sub>H</sub> has opposite sign
