Electromagnetic induction
-------------------------

### State one function of a `transformer` \[1\]
> s20_42_Q10

- To change magnitude of potential difference

### Why the output from the `transformer` is an electromotive force(e.m.f.) that is alternating \[3\]
> s20_42_Q10

- magnitude of e.m.f. varies as rate of change of flux changes
- direction of e.m.f. changes when direction of change of flux reverses/when flux changes from increasing to decreasing
- flux is continuously increasing and decreasing, so polarity of e.m.f. is continuously switching

### Why the soft-iron core of the `transformer` is laminated. \[1\]
> s20_42_Q10

- To reduce energy loss
