### The function of  a `non-inverting amplifier`: \[2\]
- Output signal proportional to input signal
- Output signal has same sign/polarity as input signal

### Explain why ... is known as a `virtual earth`: \[3\]
> s20_42_Q8

- Amplifier gain is very large/infinite
- For the amplifier not to saturate, V+ = V-
- V+ is at earth so V- is (almost) at earth

### Two effects of `negative feedback` on the gain of an amplifier: \[2\]
- greater bandwidth/gain constant over a larger range of frequencies/greater bandwidth
- smaller gain
