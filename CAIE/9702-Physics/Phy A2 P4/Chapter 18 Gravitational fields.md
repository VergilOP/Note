Gravitational fields
--------------------

### Suggest why the energy required to launch the satellite depends on whether the satellite, in its orbit, is travelling from west to east or from east to west \[1\]
> w20_42_Q1

- smaller gain in energy required if orbit is west to east
- smaller change in velocity if orbit is west to east
- smaller gain in energy if orbit is in same direction as Earth's rotation
- smaller change in velocity if orbit is in same direction as Earth's rotation
- satellite already moving west to east at launch
- Earth's rotation is from west to east
