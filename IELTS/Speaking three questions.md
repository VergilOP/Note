Basic Questions

### Study

- I'm a science student. So, I'm currently studying Maths, Physics and Computer Science as may major subject. Also, I did some selective courses like history

2. **Why did you choose to study that subject?**
- The reason why I study history is that I've found history is not only a record of something happened in the past but also very educational for the future development of human beings. For instance, we can definitely learn some wisdom that's concluded by our ancestors from some big events and use it to guide our lives.

3. **Is it very interesting?**
- Yes, it is. Sometimes reading history is like reading a novel. You might not know what would happen until it was unveiled. But, this article is from baidu website, what is more interesting is that the events that happened in history are worth studying. They give me wisdom and warn us that we should not follow the same disastrous road to ruin

4. **Do you prefer to study in the mornings or the afternoons?**
- I prefer to study in the afternoons because I am more energetic then. Although the morning is good for me to memorize something, I often can't manage to get up early.

5. **Are you looking forward to working?**
- No, I don't. I know from the daughters and sons of my parent's friends that working is really hard, which gives them little time to take a rest. Plus, working means having more responsibilities. You can't do things whenever you want.

6. **Do you like your subject?**
- Yes, I do. I'm quite into history. In my opinion, history is a subject that teaches me how to become a rational person who I want to be. Plus, I love it because our teacher teaches it in a very interesting way.

- From, my window, I can see the building next to my apartment. It was an office building that includes many little companies.

6. **Have you ever lived in the countryside?**
- I didn't live in the countryside for a long time, but I usually spent my summer holiday in the countryside in my primary school because my grandparents lived there. Since my parents both have their work in the day, I was asked to go to the countryside whe I was in summer holiday. In my memory, the life there was interesting. I had peers to play together, and my grandparents cooked yummy dishes. Most importantly, I didn't have to do homework that time.

7. **Will you live in the countryside in the future?**
- I don't think so, because I have lived in city for almost 18 years, and I have been used to living in cities. This means it is very inconvenient for me to live in the countryside. My company, my friends and my parents are all in the city, I will feel lonely if I go to the countryside
