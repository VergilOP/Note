\section{Motivation \& Aims}
The motivation behind the "Mirror News Summarizer" project is to address the challenge of information overload in digital news consumption. The project aims to create a platform that simplifies access to news by providing concise summaries, personalized content recommendations, and a user-friendly interface, thereby enhancing the efficiency and enjoyment of news reading in the digital era.

\subsection{General problem}
Expanding on the general problem of information overload in the digital age, recent statistics and studies provide a clearer understanding of this phenomenon. A Pew Research Center survey indicates that a majority of Americans engage with news across multiple platforms, with 67\% using news websites or apps, and a significant portion, 49\%, utilizing social media for news consumption \cite{pewnewsplatforms} . This digital news consumption is predominant among younger demographics, particularly those aged 18-29, who prefer digital devices over traditional media \cite{pewnewsplatforms} .

The issue is not just the volume of information but its impact on consumers. Research suggests that news overload on social media leads to exhaustion and indifference towards news \cite{frontiersinpsych2022} . The fast pace of information dissemination through mobile devices and constant updates exacerbates this problem, increasing the demand on cognitive resources and leading to a phenomenon known as "news avoidance," where consumers deliberately avoid news to reduce stress and cognitive load \cite{frontiersinpsych2022} .

This backdrop of overwhelming digital news consumption and its effects forms the basis for addressing the specific problem tackled by the "Mirror News Summarizer" project. 

\subsection{Significance of the Problem}
Building on the impact of information overload on users, it's worth highlighting the broader implications of this issue on society's collective ability to stay informed. The relentless influx of information can not only overwhelm individual users but also affect public discourse and the quality of democratic engagement. When users are bombarded with too much information, they may retreat into echo chambers or engage in selective exposure to information, reinforcing existing biases and reducing exposure to diverse viewpoints.

The phenomenon of decision fatigue further exacerbates this issue. Faced with an overwhelming array of choices and information, individuals may become less capable of making informed decisions or even opting to disengage from news consumption altogether. This trend poses significant challenges for the fabric of informed citizenship.

Although specific statistics detailing the full extent of these societal impacts are complex to pin down, research from the Pew Research Center and other organizations indicates that a substantial portion of the population feels overwhelmed by the amount of information available. For instance, Pew's findings that 20\% of Americans report feeling overloaded by information highlight the personal impact, but the societal implications—such as decreased civic engagement or increased polarization due to selective exposure—though harder to quantify, are of great concern \cite{pewnewsplatforms} .

Additionally, the role of social media in news consumption adds another layer of complexity. Platforms designed to capture and retain user attention often prioritize engaging content over informative content, potentially skewing public perception and understanding of important issues  \cite{frontiersinpsych2022} . The rapid dissemination of misinformation through these channels further complicates the landscape, making the need for effective tools to manage information overload and enhance the quality of news consumption even more pressing.

In sum, the significance of addressing information overload extends beyond individual user experience to encompass broader societal impacts. By developing solutions like the "Mirror News Summarizer," there's potential not only to improve individual well-being by reducing information overload and decision fatigue but also to contribute positively to the quality of public discourse and democratic processes.

\subsection{Prior Work on the Problem}
In addressing the problem of information overload in news consumption, several platforms have emerged with innovative solutions. Inshorts\cite{inshorts2018}, for example, distills news into concise 60-word summaries, appealing to users seeking quick updates. Feedly\cite{feedlyFeatures} offers a more customizable experience, allowing users to aggregate news from preferred sources into a single feed, enhancing control over the information influx. Flipboard\cite{flipboardMagazine} combines these approaches with a visually engaging format, presenting news in a magazine-like layout that prioritizes user interests and visual storytelling.

Despite these advancements, gaps remain in the existing solutions. While these platforms have pioneered the use of algorithms for summarization and personalization, they often rely heavily on user input for customization, which can itself become a source of overload. Moreover, the challenge of maintaining a distraction-free reading environment amidst the monetization strategies that include advertisements and sponsored content has not been fully addressed. The emphasis on visual engagement by platforms like Flipboard\cite{flipboardMagazine}, although aesthetically pleasing, sometimes detracts from the core goal of simplifying news consumption and can still contribute to cognitive overload.

To enhance the persuasiveness of this discussion, it's pertinent to consider additional examples and scholarly insights. Studies indicate that while digital platforms have made news more accessible, the sheer volume and rapid pace of updates can deter users from engaging deeply with content, leading to superficial understanding or avoidance behaviors  \cite{frontiersinpsych2022} . This underscores the need for solutions that not only condense and curate content but also present it in a way that encourages deeper engagement without overwhelming the user.

\subsection{Specific Problem}
The "Mirror News Summarizer" project endeavors to confront the nuanced challenges of modern news consumption by integrating AI-driven summarization with an intuitive, user-focused design. Its ambition is to bridge the divide between the volume of available news and the cognitive capacity of users to process this information. By synthesizing news articles into concise summaries and reflecting the original site's layout, the project aims to reduce cognitive load, preserving the user's comfort with familiar formats while streamlining their reading experience.

This endeavor acknowledges the critical feedback from existing platforms, where personalization often requires extensive user input, leading to potential information overload. The "Mirror News Summarizer" intends to leverage advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze user behavior and preferences subtly, thereby offering a more adaptive and personalized news feed without necessitating active user customization. This intelligent personalization seeks to present users with content that is not only relevant but also curated in a way that respects their time and attention span.

Furthermore, the project is committed to creating a distraction-free environment, recognizing that advertisements and pop-ups significantly detract from the quality of the user experience. By eliminating these interruptions, the "Mirror News Summarizer" aspires to foster a more focused and enjoyable reading journey, allowing users to engage with news content without the typical barriers that might discourage deep reading.

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Intention}
The "Mirror News Summarizer" project is dedicated to crafting a platform that addresses the prevalent challenge of information overload in today's digital news landscape. Central to our mission is the design of a news reading experience that is not only efficient and personalized but also deeply familiar to users. By leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to distill lengthy news articles into precise summaries, we have been meticulous in mirroring the aesthetic and structural layout of original news websites. This meticulous emulation of design elements serves as a cornerstone of the platform, as it reduces cognitive load and fosters a seamless transition between traditional news reading and our streamlined summaries.

This focus on creating a user-centric platform stems from a recognition of the cognitive demands associated with sifting through abundant news content. By maintaining the look and feel of traditional news sites, the "Mirror News Summarizer" offers users a comforting sense of familiarity, which is crucial for enhancing readability and retaining the essence of the news experience. Such design philosophy ensures that users can consume news quickly and effortlessly while still enjoying an environment that mirrors their preferred news outlets.

\subsection{Approach}
The methodology of the "Mirror News Summarizer" project is rooted in a multi-faceted approach combining data acquisition, artificial intelligence (AI), and user experience design to address the specific challenges identified.

\subsubsection{Data Acquisition and Processing}
The first step involves collecting news articles from various reputable sources. This process is facilitated through web scraping techniques that provide access to a wide range of news content. The selection of sources is guided by credibility and diversity to ensure a comprehensive news feed. The acquired data undergo preprocessing to normalize text format and remove any non-essential elements like advertisements or multimedia elements that do not contribute to the core news narrative.

For web scraping, Python's BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries are employed to navigate and extract relevant news content. JSON parsing is used to retrieve and organize data. 


\textbf{Extracting Navigation Data from HTML Content:}
This process begins by taking the input HTML content and converting it into a BeautifulSoup object for parsing. The primary task is to extract the main and secondary navigation data from the HTML.\ref{fig:navbar}
    
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Firstly, the script checks for the presence of the main navigation container within the HTML structure. If found, it iterates over each list item (`li' tag) within the container. For each item, it attempts to find an anchor (`a' tag) with a specific class indicating a link. If the anchor tag is present and contains an `href' attribute, the script constructs a relative navigation URL.
    \item Subsequently, it searches for a span containing the title within each anchor tag. The extracted URL and title are then appended to a list, which represents the entire navigation structure.
    \item Finally, the script returns this list of navigation links and compiles all extracted information into a single output.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Example Output:}
\begin{lstlisting}
return {
    'news': "BBC",
    'nav': nav,
    'nav_secondary': nav_secondary,
    'timestamp': current_time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'),
}        
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Homepage Data Extraction Process:}
The function \textit{extract\_data\_sky\_news\_homepage} orchestrates the extraction of structured news data from the given HTML content of Sky News. The process involves several steps to ensure the retrieval of relevant information, including article images, URLs, titles, authors, and news clusters.\ref{fig:maincontent}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The HTML content is parsed into a BeautifulSoup object for convenient data navigation.
    \item Individual extraction functions like \textit{extract\_img\_url}, \textit{extract\_news\_url\_and\_title}, and \textit{extract\_most\_read\_news\_url\_and\_title} are employed to pull specific elements from the HTML structure.
    \item The \textit{extract\_clusters} function assembles news articles into clusters, distinguishing between most read articles and others based on the section headers.
    \item Lastly, a comprehensive data structure is returned, encapsulating the 'news' source, an array of 'clusters' containing articles, a 'timestamp' of the extraction time, and the 'url' of the homepage.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Example Output:}
\begin{lstlisting}
return {
    'news': "Sky",
    'clusters': clusters,
    'timestamp': current_time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'),
    'url': url,
}
\end{lstlisting}

    \end{minipage}
    \hfill
    \begin{minipage}[t]{0.6\textwidth}
    \textbf{Data Extraction Process for News Content:}
    The \textit{extract\_data\_news\_content} function is designed to parse the HTML content of a BBC News article and extract valuable information including the article title, author, and main content sections.\ref{fig:newscontent}

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Parse the HTML content into a navigable object for easy querying (`soup`).
        \item Look for specific HTML tags (`article`, `div`, etc.) and extract relevant content (titles, authors, URLs, etc.).
        \item Assemble the extracted data into structured Python dictionaries, lists, or other suitable data types.
        \item Combine all pieces of extracted information into a single dictionary representing the article.
        \item Return the dictionary with all the extracted and compiled article data.
    \end{enumerate}

    \textbf{Sample Output Structure:}
    \begin{lstlisting}
return {
    'news': "BBC",
    'title': title,
    'content': ' '.join(section['content'] for section in sections), 
    'img_urls': img_urls if img_urls else '', 
    'url': url,
    'timestamp': current_time,
    'article_infos': {
        'author': author,
        'source': source,
        'date': None
    },
    'bbc_parts': {
        'related_topics': related_topics,
        'more_on_this_story': more_on_this_storys,
    },
    'sky_parts': {}, 
}
    \end{lstlisting}
    \end{minipage}

\subsubsection{AI-driven Summarization}
Upon preprocessing, the project focuses on employing AI models for the generation of concise summaries of news articles. Specifically, we leverage the capabilities of the ChatGPT API, a cutting-edge model based on the Transformer architecture, renowned for its performance in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. Unlike traditional summarization models, ChatGPT's advanced understanding and generation capabilities allow it to identify and condense the key points of news articles into succinct summaries without losing the essence of the content. 

The decision to utilize ChatGPT over other available APIs is based on several key factors that align with our project's goals of efficiency and effectiveness in summarization tasks. The following table compares ChatGPT with other notable APIs based on criteria such as performance, ease of integration, and linguistic capabilities:

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lccc}
    \hline
    \textbf{Criteria} & \textbf{ChatGPT} & \textbf{BART} & \textbf{T5} \\ \hline
    Performance & High & High & High \\
    Ease of Integration & High & Medium & Medium \\
    Linguistic Capabilities & Advanced & Advanced & Advanced \\
    Real-time Processing & Yes & Yes & Yes \\
    Cost-Effectiveness & High & Medium & Medium \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Comparison of Summarization APIs}
\end{table}
    
As illustrated, ChatGPT stands out due to its superior performance, especially in handling complex linguistic structures and generating coherent, contextually relevant summaries. Additionally, its ease of integration and cost-effectiveness make it an ideal choice for our project. In contrast, other APIs might offer real-time processing but fall short in terms of linguistic capabilities and overall summarization quality. Therefore, by leveraging ChatGPT, we aim to provide users with high-quality, efficient news summaries that cater to their interests and reading preferences.

\begin{lstlisting}
def get_summary(text, model="gpt-3.5-turbo", max_tokens=200):
    """
    This function takes a piece of text and returns its summary using OpenAI's chat model API.
    
    :param text: The text to summarize.
    :param model: The chat model to use for summarization.
    :param max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens to generate for the summary.
    :return: The summary of the text.
    """
    try:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model=model,
            messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "Summarize the following article:"},
                      {"role": "user", "content": text}],
            max_tokens=max_tokens
        )
        summary = response['choices'][0]['message']['content']
        return summary
    except openai.error.OpenAIError as e:
        # Handle the OpenAI API error appropriately
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return "An error occurred while generating the summary."
\end{lstlisting}

\newpage
\textbf{Text Summarization Process:}
The process involves taking a piece of text and generating a concise summary using OpenAI's GPT model via the API. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Prepare the Input Text:} The text that needs to be summarized is prepared and passed to the \textit{get\_summary} function along with the model choice and the maximum token limit for the summary.
    
    \item \textbf{API Request Construction:} An API request is constructed with the text, specifying the role of the text as ``user" content and setting a system message to instruct the model to ``Summarize the following article:".
    
    \item \textbf{Invoke OpenAI's ChatCompletion API:} The constructed request is sent to OpenAI's ChatCompletion API, specifying the chosen model (e.g., ``gpt-3.5-turbo") and the maximum number of tokens for the summary.
    
    \item \textbf{Process API Response:} The API responds with a summary generated by the model. The response is processed to extract the summary text from the structured response data.
    
    \item \textbf{Error Handling:} If an error occurs during the API call (e.g., network issues, API limits), the error is caught, and an appropriate error message is returned instead of a summary.
    
    \item \textbf{Return the Summary:} The generated summary is returned to the calling function, ready to be used as a concise representation of the original text.
\end{enumerate}

This streamlined process efficiently condenses lengthy text into succinct summaries, leveraging the advanced capabilities of OpenAI's GPT models.

\subsubsection{Database Storage and Retrieval}

The "Mirror News Summarizer" project is underpinned by a robust database design, central to which is the \textbf{Articles} entity. This entity is the repository for all news content, acting as the mainstay for both the summarization process and user delivery. It is expansively constructed to integrate seamlessly with the various structural components unique to different news providers.\ref{fig:article db structure}

\paragraph{Core Attributes}
The foundational \textit{Articles} table within the database comprises the following attributes essential to each news article:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{id} -- a unique identifier to manage and reference each article.
    \item \textit{title} -- the headline encapsulating the core message.
    \item \textit{content} -- the full narrative body of the news.
    \item \textit{summary} -- the algorithm-generated abridged version of the content.
    \item \textit{url} -- the URL to the original news article, ensuring credibility and reference continuity.
    \item \textit{timestamp} -- the time when the article was added to the system, crucial for timeline management.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Integration with Parts}
To accommodate the diversity of news formats, the database includes \textit{Parts} that reflect specific attributes of various news outlets. These are interconnected with the \textit{Articles} via a one-to-many relationship to enhance the contextual framework of the news content:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{BBCPart} -- comprises identifiers that link the articles to BBC's unique features like sidebar content and related topics.
    \item \textit{SkyPart} -- connects the articles to thematic clusters as categorized by Sky News, mirroring its content organization.
\end{itemize}

The \textit{Parts} extend beyond mere association; they are essential in the recreation of a news-reading experience that is both authentic and user-friendly. The user reads the summary within an interface that reflects the familiar layout and style of the original news source.

The successful execution of this structure relies on adept database operations, specifically tailored \textit{join} operations that merge the \textit{Articles} with their respective \textit{Parts}. The database schema is optimally designed to handle these operations, ensuring prompt and accurate news delivery to the user interface.

\newpage
\subsubsection{User Recommendation System}

A critical aspect of the "Mirror News Summarizer" is the personalization of content through a user recommendation system. This intelligent system curates articles that align with individual user interests, utilizing their interaction history with the platform to enhance relevance and engagement. Notably, this feature comes to life upon user authentication, ensuring that personalized content is delivered after login. 

\paragraph{The Recommendation Logic}
The recommendation logic operates in two modes: random selection for new users or similarity-based for users with interaction history. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{For New Users:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A set of twelve news articles is randomly selected from the database, ensuring no repetition \\(\textit{get\_random\_news\_from\_db} function).
        \item Articles without a proper title or with the placeholder "No title found" are excluded to maintain content quality.
        \item Each selected article's data, including title, summary, URL, and first image, is compiled into a list for display.
    \end{enumerate}
    
    \item \textbf{For Returning Users:}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The system first checks for the existence of liked articles by the user.
        \item If liked articles are present, it employs a \textit{TF-IDF Vectorizer} to transform the textual content of all articles into a mathematical representation.
        \item The similarity between the liked articles and the rest of the corpus is calculated using \textit{cosine similarity}.
        \item Articles are then scored based on their cumulative similarity to the liked articles.
        \item A user-article affinity score is updated or created in the database for later retrieval.
        \item The twelve most similar articles, excluding those already liked, are selected and their data compiled for the user.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Data Structure Utilization}
Throughout this process, the system leverages the previously detailed database structure, interacting with various tables such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Article Table} - Serves as the primary source of content for recommendations.
    \item \textit{LikedArticle Table} - Tracks the articles that have been positively interacted with by the user.
    \item \textit{ArticleAffinity Table} - Stores the affinity score, which is a quantifiable measure of the user's preference towards each article.
    \item \textit{ArticleImage and ArticleInfo Tables} - Provide additional context for each article, enhancing the user experience with visual and metadata elements.
