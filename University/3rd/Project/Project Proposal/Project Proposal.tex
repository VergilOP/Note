\section{Risks and contingency plan}

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Risk}: Web scraping tools often depend on the consistent structure of a webpage. If major news sites undergo a significant design overhaul, the scraping tools developed for the 'Mirror News Summarizer' might fail to aggregate content effectively.
    \subitem \textbf{Contingency}: Should our primary targeted news sources change their webpage structures, we plan to quickly adapt our scraping scripts. Furthermore, we'll set up periodic monitoring tools to check the efficiency of our scrapers and get alerts for potential failures.
    \item \textbf{Risk}: News websites frequently employ anti-scraping technologies and techniques to prevent automated bots from accessing their content. This can hinder the consistent inflow of news data to the platform.
    \subitem \textbf{Contingency}: In the event we encounter difficulties accessing content from a particular source, we'll pivot to integrate RSS feeds or official news APIs, which offer structured and consistent access to news articles.
    \item \textbf{Risk}: Third-party APIs often have usage limits or rate limits that could restrict the extent and frequency of operations, affecting the performance of our summarization system if the project scales up.
    \subitem \textbf{Contingency}: If we approach the API rate limits, our plan is to integrate caching mechanisms to store frequently accessed summaries. Additionally, we'll explore the possibility of incorporating other summarization algorithms or tools to diversify our backend and reduce dependency on a single API.
