### General problem

Expanding on the general problem of information overload in the digital age, recent statistics and studies provide a clearer understanding of this phenomenon. A Pew Research Center survey indicates that a majority of Americans engage with news across multiple platforms, with 67% using news websites or apps, and a significant portion, 49%, utilizing social media for news consumption【[13†source](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/news-platform-fact-sheet/)】. This digital news consumption is predominant among younger demographics, particularly those aged 18-29, who prefer digital devices over traditional media【[13†source](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/fact-sheet/news-platform-fact-sheet/)】. Despite the vast amount of information available, 20% of Americans still report feeling overwhelmed by it, highlighting a decrease from previous years but still signifying a substantial portion of the population grappling with information overload【[14†source](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/12/07/information-overload/)】.

The issue is not just the volume of information but its impact on consumers. Research suggests that news overload on social media leads to exhaustion and indifference towards news【[15†source](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.865246/full)】. The fast pace of information dissemination through mobile devices and constant updates exacerbates this problem, increasing the demand on cognitive resources and leading to a phenomenon known as "news avoidance," where consumers deliberately avoid news to reduce stress and cognitive load【[15†source](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.865246/full)】.

This backdrop of overwhelming digital news consumption and its effects forms the basis for addressing the specific problem tackled by the "Mirror News Summarizer" project. By streamlining news consumption through concise summaries and personalized content, the project aims to mitigate the effects of information overload and improve the overall news reading experience.

### Significance of the Problem

Building on the impact of information overload on users, it's worth highlighting the broader implications of this issue on society's collective ability to stay informed. The relentless influx of information can not only overwhelm individual users but also affect public discourse and the quality of democratic engagement. When users are bombarded with too much information, they may retreat into echo chambers or engage in selective exposure to information, reinforcing existing biases and reducing exposure to diverse viewpoints.

The phenomenon of decision fatigue further exacerbates this issue. Faced with an overwhelming array of choices and information, individuals may become less capable of making informed decisions or even opting to disengage from news consumption altogether. This trend poses significant challenges for the fabric of informed citizenship, crucial for a functioning democracy.

Although specific statistics detailing the full extent of these societal impacts are complex to pin down, research from the Pew Research Center and other organizations indicates that a substantial portion of the population feels overwhelmed by the amount of information available. For instance, Pew's findings that 20% of Americans report feeling overloaded by information highlight the personal impact, but the societal implications—such as decreased civic engagement or increased polarization due to selective exposure—though harder to quantify, are of great concern【[14†source](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2016/12/07/information-overload/)】.

Additionally, the role of social media in news consumption adds another layer of complexity. Platforms designed to capture and retain user attention often prioritize engaging content over informative content, potentially skewing public perception and understanding of important issues【[15†source](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.865246/full)】. The rapid dissemination of misinformation through these channels further complicates the landscape, making the need for effective tools to manage information overload and enhance the quality of news consumption even more pressing.

In sum, the significance of addressing information overload extends beyond individual user experience to encompass broader societal impacts. By developing solutions like the "Mirror News Summarizer," there's potential not only to improve individual well-being by reducing information overload and decision fatigue but also to contribute positively to the quality of public discourse and democratic processes.

### Prior Work on the Problem

In addressing the problem of information overload in news consumption, several platforms have emerged with innovative solutions. Inshorts, for example, distills news into concise 60-word summaries, appealing to users seeking quick updates. Feedly offers a more customizable experience, allowing users to aggregate news from preferred sources into a single feed, enhancing control over the information influx. Flipboard combines these approaches with a visually engaging format, presenting news in a magazine-like layout that prioritizes user interests and visual storytelling.
