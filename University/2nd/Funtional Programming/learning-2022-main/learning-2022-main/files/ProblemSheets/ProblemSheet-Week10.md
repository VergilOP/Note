# Problem Sheet for Week 10

This week's problems have a [template](Week10-Template.hs) which you can use to get started.  In order to use it, you will need to enable the packages `random` and `mtl`.  On Jupyter, you can do this in ghci with the commands

```hs
:set -package mtl
:set -package random
```

Alternatively, you may run `ghci` with these packages enabled as follows:

```
ghci -package mtl -package random Week10.hs
```
after copying `Week10-Template.hs` to `Week10.hs`.

## Type Constructors and Functors

A **type constructor** is a function on types.  That is, given an abstract type
`a`, it produces a new type which depends on `a`.  You have met many examples
already.  Here are just a few:

```hs
type F1 a = Maybe a
type F2 a = Either a String
type F3 a = [ a ]
type F4 a = BinT a
type F5 a = Int -> a
type F6 a = (a -> Int) -> Int
type F7 a = RoseT a
type F8 a = ThreeT a
type F9 a = Expr a 
```
where types `F4`,`F7`,`F8` and `F9` refer to the following data type definitions:
```haskell
data BinT a =
  Leaf | Node (BinT a) a (BinT a)
  deriving Show

data RoseT a =
  Lf | Nd a [ RoseT a ]
  deriving Show

data ThreeT a =
  Lf3 | Nd3 a (RoseT (ThreeT a))
  deriving Show

data Expr a = Var a | Val Int | Add (Expr a) (Expr a)
  deriving Show
```

Recall that we say that a type constructor is a **functor** if, given a function `f :: a -> b` between two input types, we can produce a function `fmap f :: FN a -> FN b` between the output types.

This idea is encapsulated by the haskell type class `Functor`:

```hs
class Functor f where
 fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b
```

where in this definition `f` is an abstract type constructor.

1. Implement the function `fmap` for all of the above type constructors.

1. You may get the impression from this list that *every* type constructor is a functor.  What
happens when you try to implement `fmap` for dual of `F5` from above?  That is, for the type constructor
	```hs
	type NotAFunctor a = a -> Int
	```
1. All of the type constructors `F1`,`F2`,`F3`,`F5`,`F6` and `F9` above are monads. Try to find implementations for as many of them as you can (without looking at the implementations from the prelude, if these exist).

## Using Monads

1. Recall the type of rose trees:
	```hs
	data Rose a = Br (a, [ Rose a ])
	```
	Use the `State` monad to implement a function
	```
	labelRose :: Rose a -> Rose (Int,a)
	```
	which decorates every node in the tree with a *fresh* index.

2. Use the IO monad to read a line of input from the user and print a response.

3. Create a simple [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) which reads line of text and prints the same line with the words reversed.  You may wish to look up the haskell prelude functions `words` and `unwords`.  The program should quit when the user enters and empty line.

## A Picking Monad

As you may remember from [the notes](../LectureNotes/Sections/Data2.md#bstsort), a form of [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) is easy to write in Haskell:
```hs
qsort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
qsort [] = []
qsort (x:xs) = qsort [l | l <- xs, l < x]
		   ++ [x]
		   ++ qsort [r | r <- xs, r >= x]
```
However, this implementation &mdash; where in the recursive case we always pick the first element of the list as the "pivot" &mdash; has the [serious defect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort#Choice_of_pivot) that it leads to O(nÂ²) running time on lists that are nearly sorted (or reverse-sorted).
A better way of implementing Quicksort, with expected O(n log n) running time, is to instead pick a random element of the list as a pivot.

In order to encapsulate the action of picking a pivot, let us introduce a class of "picking monads":
```haskell
class Monad m => PickingMonad m where
  pick :: Int -> Int -> m Int
```
A picking monad includes all of the operations of an ordinary monad (`return` and `>>=`), but also an operation `pick lo hi`, with the intended interpretation that it should pick a number between `lo` and `hi` (i.e. `lo <= pick lo hi <= hi`) in some way (say by calling a random number generator, or by returning their mean).

**Problem:** Implement a new version of Quicksort
```haskell
qsort :: (Ord a, PickingMonad m) => [a] -> m [a]
qsort = undefined
```
which makes appropriate calls to `pick` in order to choose the pivot.
Your new version should:
1. have expected running time O(n log n) given an implementation of `pick lo hi` that always returns a uniformly random number between `lo` and `hi`
2. behave equivalently to the original version given an implementation of `pick lo hi` that always returns `lo`

In order to test your code, you'll need some examples of picking monads.  A simple if trivial thing to do is to always pick the lower bound `lo`, and this choice makes the `Identity` monad into an example of a picking monad since it does not require any additional features:
```haskell
instance PickingMonad Identity where
 pick lo hi = Identity lo
```

Perhaps more interestingly, we can make the `IO` monad into a picking monad by using the system's random number generator.  Note that we also verify in this case that `lo <= hi` for consistency purposes:
```haskell
instance PickingMonad IO where
  pick lo hi | lo <= hi  = getStdRandom (randomR (lo, hi))
             | otherwise = error ("pick lo hi: lo = " ++ show lo ++ " is greater than hi = " ++ show hi)
```

We can now force haskell to use one of these implementations by specifying the return type from `qsort`:
```hs
> qsort [10,9..1] :: IO [Integer]
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
> qsort [10,9..1] :: Identity [Integer]
Identity [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
```

## Picking monads and probability distributions

Another possibility for the implementation of a picking monad is the [List monad](../../../LectureNotes/monads.md).  For this implementation, the `pick` operation just returns the list of **all** possible values (after checking that `lo <= hi`):
```haskell
instance PickingMonad [] where
  pick lo hi | lo <= hi  = [lo..hi]
             | otherwise = error ("pick lo hi: lo = " ++ show lo ++ " is greater than hi = " ++ show hi)
```
A more sophisticated version of this idea is to additionally give *weights* or *probabilities* to the possible values.  This leads to the idea of a picking monad based on *finite probability distributions*:
```haskell
newtype Dist a = Dist { dist :: [(a,Rational)] }  deriving (Show)

instance Monad Dist where
  return x = Dist [(x,1)]
  xm >>= f = Dist [(y,p*q) | (x,p) <- dist xm, (y,q) <- dist (f x)]
```
together with the standard boilerplate:
```haskell
instance Functor Dist where
  fmap f xm = xm >>= return . f

instance Applicative Dist where
  pure = return
  xm <*> ym = xm >>= \x -> ym >>= return . x
```
And then the `pick` operation can be implemented as follows:
```haskell
instance PickingMonad Dist where
  pick lo hi | lo <= hi = Dist [(x,1 / fromIntegral (hi - lo + 1)) | x <- [lo..hi]]
             | otherwise = error ("pick lo hi: lo = " ++ show lo ++ " is greater than hi = " ++ show hi)
```
This defines `pick lo hi` as a probability distribution taking any value between `lo` and `hi` with equal probability, in other words, as the [uniform distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_uniform_distribution) on the interval `[lo .. hi]`.

To illustrate these different implementations of picking monads, consider the following simple program that picks a number between 0 and 3 and then uses it to index into the string "hello":
```haskell
code :: PickingMonad m => m Char
code = do
  i <- pick 0 3
  return ("hello" !! i)
```

Here is a sample transcript of running `code` using the `IO` monad by default.  Notice that multiple runs can give different results, as should be expected:
```hs
> code   -- this runs in the IO monad by default
'h'
> code
'l'
```
Running the same code in the list implementation simple returns *all* the possible choices we could have made:
```hs
> code :: [Char]
"hell"
```
Finally, running `code` using the monad of finite probability distributions again returns all the possible choices, but additionally returns information about the probability of each choice:
```hs
> code :: Dist Char
Dist {dist = [('h',1 % 4),('e',1 % 4),('l',1 % 4),('l',1 % 4)]}
```
Observe that our representation of finite probability distributions allows the same value to occur multiple times in the list of value/probability pairs.  The following helper function will compute the *total* probability of a value occurring in a given distribution, assuming that the values come from an `Eq` type:

```haskell
prob :: Eq a => Dist a -> a -> Rational
prob xm x = sum [p | (y,p) <- dist xm, x == y]
```
If we have a distribution, it is often useful to group together equal values and adjust the probabilities accordingly.  This can be accomplished using the following helper function:
```haskell
normalise :: Eq a => Dist a -> Dist a
normalise xm = Dist [(x,prob xm x) | x <- support xm]
  where
    support :: Eq a => Dist a -> [a]
    support xm = nub [x | (x,p) <- dist xm, p > 0]  -- "nub" removes duplicates from a list
```

Examples:
```hs
> prob code 'l'
1 % 2
> normalise code
Dist {dist = [('h',1 % 4),('e',1 % 4),('l',1 % 2)]}
```
(We didn't need to put any type annotations above, since the type `code :: Dist Char` is automatically inferred from the calls to `prob` and `normalise`.)

## Using the Picking Monad

Now that we have a number of picking monads to play with, we'll start implementing some functions using them.  Since we'll be picking lots of things, how about picking from a deck of cards?  Here're some data types for representing playing cards:

```haskell
data Rank = R2 | R3 | R4 | R5 | R6 | R7 | R8 | R9 | R10 | RJ | RQ | RK | RA
  deriving (Eq,Ord,Enum)
data Suit  = C | D | H | S
  deriving (Eq,Ord,Enum)
data Card = Card { rank :: Rank, suit :: Suit }
  deriving (Eq)
type Deck = [Card]

standard52 :: Deck
standard52 = [Card {rank = r, suit = s} | r <- [R2 .. RA], s <- [C .. S]]
```
1. Write a function which chooses an arbitrary element from a list.
	```haskell
	choose :: PickingMonad m => [a] -> m a
	choose = undefined
	```
	More precise requirements:
	* `choose xs` should run without error for any non-empty list `xs :: [a]` (for the empty list it can do anything)
	* in the case of the monad `m = IO`, `choose xs` should run in time proportional to the length of `xs`
	* in the case of the monad `m = Dist`, `choose xs :: Dist a` should compute a (not necessarily normalised) distribution where each value in `xs` is assigned a probability proportional to the number of times it occurs in `xs`.  That is, `prob xs x` should be equal to `k / n`, where `k = length [y | y <- xs, x == y]` and `n = length xs`.

	Examples:
	```hs
	> choose standard52  -- multiple runs in the IO monad can return different results
	10â£
	> choose standard52
	Kâ 
	> choose [True,False] :: Dist Bool
	Dist {dist = [(True,1 % 2),(False,1 % 2)]}
	> prob (choose "hello") 'l'
	2 % 5
	```

1. Write a function which takes a monadic computation of a boolean (an "experiment") and runs it repeatedly, returning how many times it evaluates to `True`.
	```haskell
	simulate :: Monad m => m Bool -> Integer -> m Integer
	simulate = undefined
	```
	More precise requirements:
	* `simulate bm n` should run without error for any non-negative integer `n` (for `n < 0` it can do anything)
	* in the case of the monad `m = IO`, `simulate bm n` should run in time proportional to `n`
	* in the case of the monad `m = Dist`, `prob (simulate bm n) k` should give the probability that if the experiment `bm` is repeated `n` times, it will return `True` exactly `k` times.

	Examples:
	```hs
	> simulate (choose [True,False]) 100000
	49932
	> normalise (simulate (choose [True,False]) 3)
	Dist {dist = [(3,1 % 8),(2,3 % 8),(1,3 % 8),(0,1 % 8)]}
	```

1. Write a function which returns an arbitrary splitting of a list into two contiguous pieces.
	```haskell
	cut :: PickingMonad m => [a] -> m ([a],[a])
	cut = undefined
	```
	More precise requirements:
	* `cut xs` should run without error for any list `xs :: [a]` (including the empty list)
	* in the case of the monad `m = IO`, `cut xs` should return a pair of lists `(ys,zs)` whose concatenation `ys ++ zs` is `xs`, in time proportional to the length of `xs`
	* in the case of the monad `m = [ ]`, `cut xs :: [([a],[a])]` should compute the list of all possible pairs `(ys,zs)` whose concatenation `ys ++ zs` is `xs` (without duplicates)
	* in the case of the monad `m = Dist`, `cut xs :: Dist ([a],[a])` should compute the uniform distribution on all possible pairs of lists `(ys,zs)` whose concatenation `ys ++ zs` is `xs`.

	Examples:
	```hs
	> cut standard52
	([2â£,2â¦,2â¥,2â ,3â£,3â¦,3â¥,3â ,4â£,4â¦,4â¥,4â ,5â£,5â¦,5â¥],[5â ,6â£,6â¦,6â¥,6â ,7â£,7â¦,7â¥,7â ,8â£,8â¦,8â¥,8â ,9â£,9â¦,9â¥,9â ,10â£,10â¦,10â¥,10â ,Jâ£,Jâ¦,Jâ¥,Jâ ,Qâ£,Qâ¦,Qâ¥,Qâ ,Kâ£,Kâ¦,Kâ¥,Kâ ,Aâ£,Aâ¦,Aâ¥,Aâ ])
	> cut [1..5] :: [([Int],[Int])]
	[([],[1,2,3,4,5]),([1],[2,3,4,5]),([1,2],[3,4,5]),([1,2,3],[4,5]),([1,2,3,4],[5]),([1,2,3,4,5],[])]
	> cut [1..5] :: Dist ([Int],[Int])
	Dist {dist = [(([],[1,2,3,4,5]),1 % 6),(([1],[2,3,4,5]),1 % 6),(([1,2],[3,4,5]),1 % 6),(([1,2,3],[4,5]),1 % 6),(([1,2,3,4],[5]),1 % 6),(([1,2,3,4,5],[]),1 % 6)]}
	```

1. Write a function which returns an arbitrary [shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuffling) of a pair of lists. 

	```haskell
	shuffle :: PickingMonad m => ([a],[a]) -> m [a]
	shuffle = undefined
	```
	More precise requirements:
	* `shuffle (ys,zs)` should run without error for any pair of lists `ys, zs :: [a]` (including the empty lists)
	* in the case of the monad `m = IO`, `shuffle (ys,zs)` should return a list that is a possible interleaving of `ys` with `zs`, in time proportional to the sum of the lengths of `ys` and `zs`
	* in the case of the monad `m = Dist`, `shuffle (ys,zs) :: Dist [a]` should give the uniform distribution on all possible interleavings of `ys` with `zs`.

	Note the last requirement is a bit subtle.
	One way to get a uniform distribution is via the [Gilbert-Shannon-Reeds model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert%E2%80%93Shannon%E2%80%93Reeds_model) of shuffling, where the probability of picking the head of the shuffle from `ys` (respectively, from `zs`) is `m/(m+n)` (respectively, `n/(m+n)`), where `m = length ys` and `n = length zs`.

	Examples:
	```hs
	> shuffle ("hello", "world!")
	"hewolrllod!"
	> normalise (shuffle ("Aa","Bb"))
	Dist {dist = [("AaBb",1 % 6),("ABab",1 % 6),("ABba",1 % 6),("BAab",1 % 6),("BAba",1 % 6),("BbAa",1 % 6)]}
	```

1. Write a higher-order function which performs n iterations of a "[riffle shuffle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riffle_shuffle_permutation)" by repeatedly cutting a list in two and then shuffling the two halves back together, where the specific cut and shuffle functions are passed as extra arguments.
	```haskell
	riffles :: PickingMonad m => ([a] -> m ([a],[a])) -> (([a],[a]) -> m [a]) -> Int -> [a] -> m [a]
	riffles = undefined
	```
	More precise requirements:
	* `riffles cf sf n xs` should run without error for any list `xs` and integer `n >= 0`, assuming the functions `cf` and `sf` run without error for all inputs
	* in the case of the monad `m = IO`, `riffles cf sf n xs` should return a list that is a possible `n`-fold riffle shuffle of `xs` using the cut function `cf` and shuffle function `sf`, making `n` total calls each to the functions `cf` and `sf`
	* in the case of the monad `m = Dist`, `riffle cf sf n xs :: Dist [a]` should compute the correct distribution over all possible `n`-fold riffle shuffles of `xs`, according to the cut function `cf` and shuffle function `sf`.

	Examples:
	```hs
	> riffles cut shuffle 7 standard52
	[10â£,10â¦,9â£,Kâ£,10â¥,Aâ¦,2â¥,4â¦,2â¦,6â¥,8â£,2â£,Aâ ,Kâ ,6â ,6â£,Kâ¦,2â ,3â¥,8â¥,Qâ¥,Qâ ,4â¥,8â ,10â ,Aâ¥,Jâ£,7â£,Jâ ,6â¦,Jâ¦,3â£,3â ,5â¥,9â¦,5â£,9â¥,Aâ£,3â¦,7â¦,5â ,4â ,7â¥,7â ,4â£,Kâ¥,Qâ£,Jâ¥,9â ,5â¦,Qâ¦,8â¦]
	> riffles cut (\(xs,ys) -> return (xs++ys)) 7 standard52   -- cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zarrow_shuffle
	[2â£,2â¦,2â¥,2â ,3â£,3â¦,3â¥,3â ,4â£,4â¦,4â¥,4â ,5â£,5â¦,5â¥,5â ,6â£,6â¦,6â¥,6â ,7â£,7â¦,7â¥,7â ,8â£,8â¦,8â¥,8â ,9â£,9â¦,9â¥,9â ,10â£,10â¦,10â¥,10â ,Jâ£,Jâ¦,Jâ¥,Jâ ,Qâ£,Qâ¦,Qâ¥,Qâ ,Kâ£,Kâ¦,Kâ¥,Kâ ,Aâ£,Aâ¦,Aâ¥,Aâ ]
	> normalise (riffles cut shuffle 5 [1..3])
	Dist {dist = [([1,2,3],1889 % 7776),([2,1,3],31 % 192),([2,3,1],31 % 192),([1,3,2],31 % 192),([3,1,2],31 % 192),([3,2,1],865 % 7776)]}
	```
1. Write function which returns a random permutation of a list.
	```haskell
	permute :: PickingMonad m => [a] -> m [a]
	permute = undefined
	```
	More precise requirements:
	* `permute xs` should run without error for any list `xs :: [a]` (including the empty list)
	* in the case of the monad `m = IO`, `permute xs` should return a permutation of `xs`, in time at worst quadratic in the length of `xs`
	* in the case of the monad `m = []`, `permute xs :: [[a]]` should compute the list of all possible permutations of `xs` (without duplicates)
	* in the case of the monad `m = Dist`, `permute xs :: Dist [a]` should give the uniform distribution on all possible permutations of `xs`.

	To meet these requirements, you might consider the following simple recursive algorithm, which generates a uniformly random permutation of a list in quadratic time:

	0. if the list is empty, return the empty list
	1. otherwise, generate a random permutation of the tail of the list
	2. insert the head of the list into the resulting permutation at a
	   uniformly random position

	Examples:
	```hs
	> permute standard52
	[10â ,8â¥,8â¦,7â ,6â£,4â ,Jâ¥,2â¥,Qâ£,4â¦,2â¦,3â£,2â£,7â£,9â ,9â¥,3â ,5â£,Aâ ,9â£,3â¦,Kâ ,Kâ¥,7â¦,10â¥,Jâ£,Jâ¦,4â¥,3â¥,6â¥,6â¦,5â ,5â¦,8â£,9â¦,Aâ£,Aâ¦,Kâ¦,Qâ ,4â£,Kâ£,10â¦,5â¥,10â£,8â ,Qâ¥,Aâ¥,Jâ ,7â¥,2â ,6â ,Qâ¦]
	> permute [1..3] :: [[Int]]
	[[1,2,3],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[1,3,2],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]
	> normalise (permute [1..3])
	Dist {dist = [([1,2,3],1 % 6),([2,1,3],1 % 6),([2,3,1],1 % 6),([1,3,2],1 % 6),([3,1,2],1 % 6),([3,2,1],1 % 6)]}
	```
	
1. Write a function which returns a random binary tree with a given list of leaves.
	```haskell
	data Bin a = L a | B (Bin a) (Bin a)  deriving (Show,Eq)

	genTree :: PickingMonad m => [a] -> m (Bin a)
	genTree = undefined
	```
	More precise requirements:
	* `genTree xs` should run without error for any non-empty list `xs :: [a]` (for the empty list it can do anything)
	* in the case of the monad `m = IO`, `genTree xs` should return a binary tree whose canopy is a permutation of `xs`, in time at worst quadratic in the length of `xs` (The _canopy_ of a tree is the list of leaves of the tree as they appear in an in-order traversal.)
	* in the case of the monad `m = []`, `genTree xs :: [Bin a]` should compute the list of all possible binary trees whose canopy is a permutation of `xs`  (without duplicates)
	* in the case of the monad `m = Dist`, `genTree xs :: Dist (Bin a)` should give the uniform distribution on all possible binary trees whose canopy is a permutation of `xs`.

	To meet these requirements, you might consider the following simple recursive algorithm (known as *RÃ©my's algorithm*), which generates a uniformly random binary tree with a given list of leaves in quadratic time (or even linear time with a clever implementation, see p.16 of [Knuth, volume 4a, pre-fascicle 4a](http://web.archive.org/web/20190713015719/http://www.cs.utsa.edu/~wagner/knuth/fasc4a.pdf)):

	0. If the list is `[x]`, return a leaf labelled by `x`.
	1. Otherwise, generate a random binary tree whose canopy is a permutation of the tail
	2. Uniform randomly pick a subtree of the resulting tree, and replace it by a binary node which has the old subtree as one child, and a leaf labelled by the head of the list as the other child (flip a coin to decide whether the new leaf goes to the left or right).

	Examples:
	```hs
	> genTree [1,2] :: [Bin Int]
	[B (L 1) (L 2),B (L 2) (L 1)]
	> prob (genTree [1..4]) (B (L 3) (B (B (L 1) (L 4)) (L 2)))
	1 % 120
	> prob (genTree [1..4]) (B (B (L 4) (L 1)) (B (L 2) (L 3)))
	1 % 120
	> genTree standard52
	B (L 10â¥) (B (L 4â¥) (B (B (B (B (B (L Jâ¥) (B (B (L 10â¦) (B (L 6â ) (L Jâ¦))) (L 2â¦))) (L 6â¥)) (B (B (B (B (B (B (L 6â£) (B (B (B (L Kâ¦) (L 8â )) (B (L 5â¥) (L Qâ¥))) (L 3â¥))) (B (L 7â¥) (L 3â£))) (L 6â¦)) (B (B (B (B (B (B (B (L 9â¥) (B (L Aâ¥) (L 4â ))) (L 2â£)) (L 9â¦)) (L Kâ£)) (B (L 8â¦) (L 7â¦))) (B (B (B (B (L 5â ) (L Qâ¦)) (B (L 7â ) (B (L 5â£) (B (L 2â ) (L Kâ ))))) (B (L Qâ ) (L 9â ))) (B (L 8â£) (L 8â¥)))) (L Jâ ))) (L Aâ )) (B (B (B (L Jâ£) (B (L 3â ) (L Kâ¥))) (L 9â£)) (L 10â )))) (B (L Aâ£) (L 4â£))) (B (B (B (L 5â¦) (B (L 3â¦) (B (B (L 7â£) (B (L Aâ¦) (L Qâ£))) (L 2â¥)))) (L 4â¦)) (L 10â£))))
	```
