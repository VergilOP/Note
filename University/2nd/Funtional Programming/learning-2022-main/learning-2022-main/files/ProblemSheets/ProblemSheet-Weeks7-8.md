# Problem Sheet for Weeks 7 and 8

## Using Maybe Types

1. Rewrite the `head` and `tail` functions from the prelude so that
    they use the `Maybe` type constructor to indicate when provided
    the argument was empty.

	```haskell
    headMaybe :: [a] -> Maybe a
    headMaybe = undefined

    tailMaybe :: [a] -> Maybe [a]
    tailMaybe = undefined
    ```

1. Similarly, rewrite `take :: Int -> [a] -> [a]` to use `Maybe` to indicate
    when the index is longer than the list.

	```haskell
    takeMaybe :: Int -> [a] -> Maybe [a]
    takeMaybe = undefined
    ```

1.  A common use of the `Either` type constructor is to return information
    about a possible error condition.  Rewrite the function `zip` from the
	prelude as

	```haskell
	zipEither :: [a] -> [b] -> Either String [(a,b)]
    zipEither = undefined
	```
	so that we only get the list of pairs when the two arguments have
	the same length.  If this is not the case, use the `String` to report
	which argument was smaller.

## Type Retractions

1. Recall the data type
    ```haskell
	data WeekDay = Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun
				   deriving (Show, Read, Eq, Ord, Enum)
    ```
	defined in the Lecture Notes.  Define a new data type which
	represents just the **working days** of the week.  Show that
	it is a retract of the above type.

    You are expected to defined the following type and write the
    following two functions:

	```haskell
	data WorkingDay = ???

	toWeekDay :: WorkingDay -> WeekDay
    toWeekDay = undefined

	toWorkingDay :: WeekDay -> WorkingDay
    toWorkingDay = undefined
    ```

1.  Show that the type `Maybe a` is a retract of the type `[a]`.
    You are expected to write the following two functions:

	```hs
    toList :: Maybe a -> [a]
    toList = undefined

    toMaybe :: [a] -> Maybe a
    toMaybe = undefined
    ```

## User Defined Data Types

1. Define a type of binary trees
    ```haskell
    data BinLN a b = ???
    ```
	which carries an element of type `a` at each leaf, and an element
	of type `b` at each node.

1. Using the datatype from the previous problem, write a function
    ```haskell
	leaves :: BinLN a b -> [a]
    leaves = undefined
	```
    which collects the list of elements decorating the leaves of the
	given tree.

1. Implement a new version of binary trees which carries data **only**
   at the leaves.
    ```haskell
    data BinL a = ???
    ```

1. Using the datatype from the previous examples, and supposing the type `a`
    has an instance of `Show`, implement a function which renders the tree
	as a collection of parentheses enclosing the elements at the leaves.
    ```haskell
    showBin :: Show a => BinL a -> String
    showBin = undefined
	```
	For example:
    ```hs
	*Main> showBin (Nd (Lf 1) (Nd (Lf 3) (Lf 4)))
    "((1)((3)(4)))"
	```

1. **Harder** Can you write a function which, given such a well parenthesized string
    of numbers, produces the corresponding tree?  You may want to use
	`Maybe` or `Either` to report when this string is ill-formed.  (You
	may wish to look up the `read` function for help converting strings
	to integer types.)

## Additional exercises on trees

1. Define the _right grafting_ operation
	```haskell
	(//) :: BT a -> BT a -> BT a 
	(//) = undefined
	```
	such that `r // s` inserts `s` as the rightmost subtree of `r`.

	For example if `r` is
	```
		   4
		  / \
		 7
		/\
	```
	and `s` is 
	```
		   1
		  / \
	```
	then `r // s` should be 
	```
		   4
		  / \
		 7   1
		/\  / \ 
	```
2. Do the same for _left grafting_
	```haskell
	(\\) :: BT a -> BT a -> BT a 
	(\\) = undefined
	```
3. Given a binary tree, let us label the leaves from left to right starting at 0.  Each node then determines a pair of integers `(i,j)` where `i` is the index of its left-most leaf and `j` is the index of its rightmost leaf.  Write a function:
	```haskell
	leafIndices :: BT a -> BT (Int,Int)
	leafIndices = undefined
	```
	Which replaces each node with the pair `(i,j)` of indices of its left and right-most leaves.

	For example, the tree:
	```
		   a
		  /  \
		 b    c
		/ \  / \ 
		        d
		       / \
	```
	would be mapped to the tree
	```
		  (0,4)
		  /    \
		(0,1)  (2,4)
		 / \   /   \ 
		          (3,4)
		          /   \
	```
	
4.  Recall the data type we developed in [lecture](https://git.cs.bham.ac.uk/fp/learning-2022/-/blob/main/files/LectureNotes/LiveCoding/lecture7.hs) for [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) data.
	```haskell
	data Json = JNull
		  | JStr String
		  | JNum Float
		  | JBool Bool
		  | JArr [Json]
		  | JObj [(String, Json)]
	```
    Write a function 
	```haskell
	allValues :: Json -> String -> [Json]
	allValues = undefined
	```
	so that `allValues json key` recursively finds all values associated with the string `key` occuring in instances of the `JObj` constructor.

## Homework

This homework will be marked but not counted towards your final grade. You will write your code on JupyterLab and
submit via Canvas (link below).

- Create new directory in your workspace on JupyterLab and upload/copy the files found under the `Homework7` directory.
- Copy the file `Homework7-Template.hs` to a new file called `Homework7.hs`.
- Solve the exercises below in the file `Homework7.hs`.
- Run the pre-submit script to check for any (compilation) errors **before** submitting by running in the terminal:

```bash
$ ./presubmit.sh Homework7
```
- Submit your file `Homework7.hs` via Canvas at: https://canvas.bham.ac.uk/courses/65655/assignments/389041 .
- You also require the file `Types.hs` to be in the same directory as `Homework7.hs`. The file `Types.hs` should **not** be modified, and should **not** be submitted on Canvas.

### Text messaging
(From "Haskell Programming")

Remember old-fashioned phone inputs for writing text, where
you had to press a button multiple times to get different letters to
come up? You may still have to do this when you try to search for a
movie to watch using your television remote control. Youâ€™re going to
write code to translate sequences of button presses into strings and
vice versa.
Here is the layout of the phone:
```
-----------------------------------------
| 1      | 2 ABC | 3 DEF  |
-----------------------------------------
| 4 GHI  | 5 JKL | 6 MNO  |
-----------------------------------------
| 7 PQRS | 8 TUV | 9 WXYZ |
-----------------------------------------
| *      | 0     | # .,   |
-----------------------------------------
```
The star (`*`) capitalizes the next letter (if you press it twice, then it reverts to lower case).  If there are multiple occurrences of `*` in a row, then it is the last one which will determine the capitalization.  `0` is your space bar. To represent the digit itself, you press that digit once more than the letters it represents. If you press a button one more than is required to type the digit, it wraps around to the first letter. For example:
```
2 -> 'a'
22 -> 'b'
222 -> 'c'
2222 -> '2'
22222 -> 'a'
0 -> ' '
00 -> '0'
000 -> ' '
1 -> '1'
11 -> '1'
111 -> '1'
```
You will not need to type '#', so
```
# -> '.'
## -> ','
### -> '.'
```

 Consider the following datatypes:
```haskell
-- Valid buttons are ['0'..'9']++['*','#']
type Button = Char
-- Valid presses are [1..]
type Presses = Int
-- Valid text consists of
-- ['A'..'Z']++['a'...'z']++['0'..'9']++['.',',',' ']
type Text = String
```
#### Exercise 7a.
Write a function
```haskell
phoneToString :: [(Button, Presses)] -> Text
phoneToString = undefined
```
that takes a list of buttons and the number of times to press them and gives back the corresponding text, e.g.
```hs
phoneToString [('*',1),('6',5),('5',4)] = "M5"
```

#### Exercise 7b.
Write a function
```haskell
stringToPhone :: Text -> [(Button, Presses)]
stringToPhone = undefined
```
taking a string to a list of buttons and the number of times that they need to be pressed, e.g.
```hs
stringToPhone "Hi, students." = [('*',1),('4',2),('4',3),('#',2),('0',1),('7',4),('8',1),('8',2),('3',1),('3',2),('6',2),('8',1),('7',4),('#',1)]
```

#### Exercise 7c.
Write a function
```haskell
fingerTaps :: Text -> Presses
fingerTaps = undefined
```
that computes the minimal number of button presses needed to input the given string, e.g.
```hs
fingerTaps "Hi, students." = 27
```
