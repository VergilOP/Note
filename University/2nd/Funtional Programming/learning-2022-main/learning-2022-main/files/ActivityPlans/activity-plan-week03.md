# Activity Plan for Week 3

There is also an [Activity Plan for Dubai Students](./activity-plan-week03-dubai.md).

## Summary

In Week 3 of the Functional Programming module, we will:

 * Study the list comprehensions and see how these could be used/reused for generating lists of values.

 * Study recursion and understand how functions could be defined in terms of themselves - a more natural way of defining functions.

 * Understand the concept of higher-order function, where we can pass functions as parameters to other functions.

## Lab Session: how to prepare

You must:

 1. Make sure you have done the [problem sheet for Week 2](../ProblemSheets/ProblemSheet-Week2.md).
 2. Make sure you have done all the [required reading for Week 2](../ActivityPlans/activity-plan-week02.md).

The materials for the Lab Session will be available at

 3. [Problem sheets](../ProblemSheets/README.md)

## Before the Friday lecture

You must read the following handouts:

 4. [List Comprehensions](../LectureNotes/Sections/list_comprehensions.md)
 5. [Recursive Functions](../LectureNotes/Sections/recursive_functions.md)

## After the Friday lecture

You must read the following handout:

 6. [Higher-order Functions](../LectureNotes/Sections/higher-order_functions.md)
