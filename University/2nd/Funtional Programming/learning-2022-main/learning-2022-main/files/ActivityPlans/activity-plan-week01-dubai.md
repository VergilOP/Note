# Activity Plan for Week 1 (Dubai Students)

 0. Read [Important module information](https://git.cs.bham.ac.uk/fp/learning-2022/-/blob/main/README.md)

## Summary

In Week 1 of the Functional Programming module, we will:

 1. Have a general overview of the module with the Game of Life.

 2. Study types.

 3. Study polymorphism.
 
## Activities **after** the in-person lecture

 4. Read handout [Introduction to Haskell - Conway's Game of Life](../LectureNotes/Sections/Life.md).

 5. Read handout - [Types in Haskell](../LectureNotes/Sections/types.md)
 
## Lab Session: how to prepare

 6. All Dubai students are in the same lab group. Lab sessions are scheduled on Thursdays.

The first lab session doesn't require any preparation, but here is the problem sheet we will use if you want to look at it in advance:

 7. [Lab 1 problem sheet](../ProblemSheets/ProblemSheet-Week1.md)

We will also cover Polymorphism during the lecture/lab on Thursday.

Each lab session will start with a 10 minute explanation of the activities you have to perform in the lab. Module lecturer will be available to support you.

## Activities **after** the lab / lecture

 8. Read handout - [Polymorphism](../LectureNotes/Sections/polymorphism.md)
