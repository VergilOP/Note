# Activity Plan for Week 7

There is also an [Activity Plan for Dubai Students](./activity-plan-week07-dubai.md).

## Summary

In Week 7 of the Functional Programming module, we will continue to study user defined data types. No new handouts will be given for this week.

## Lab Session

 1. There is no lab session on Tuesday or Thursday.
 2. But additional, optional lab sessions before the Class Test 1 will be announced on Teams.

## Class Test

 3. Tuesday 12:00-14:00.
 4. This is to be taken remotely, but you can use the lab.

## Before the Friday lecture

 5. Read [User defined data types I](/files/LectureNotes/Sections/Data1.md) if you haven't done so already.
 6. Read the section on binary search trees of [User defined data types II](/files/LectureNotes/Sections/Data2.md).

## After the Friday lecture

 7. You must read the remaining sections of [User defined data types II](/files/LectureNotes/Sections/Data2.md).

## Additional reading

 8. Section 8.4, "Recursive data types" of [Programming in Haskell](https://rl.talis.com/3/bham/lists/C9A9B3B5-0505-08C0-23A3-2A6A14A3CB1E.html?lang=en).
