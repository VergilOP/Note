{-

This Haskell program converts an md file to an hs by removing
everything that is not Haskell code.

  * Lines between "```haskell" and "```" are copied.

  * However, lines between "```hs" and "```" are not copied,
    deliberately. This is to be able to control what to copy or not,
    while still retaining syntax highlighting in both cases.
