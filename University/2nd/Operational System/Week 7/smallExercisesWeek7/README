There are two solutions to this problem:

1. Pass the value as an integer. This solution is implemented in
charDeviceDriverInteger.c. This is easy to implement in the kernel
side but you will need to use the write system call to transfer the
value to the kernel.

2. Pas the value as a string. This solution is implemented in
charDeviceDriverStrings.c. The kernel implementation is a bit more
complicated, but you can use the echo-command to transfer the value to
the kernel.
