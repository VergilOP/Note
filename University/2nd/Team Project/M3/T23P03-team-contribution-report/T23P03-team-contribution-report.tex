\section*{The Outcome of the Intervention Meeting}

During the intervention meeting, our team discussed the importance of effective communication, collaboration, and active participation in the project. We acknowledged that frequent meetings and open dialogue were crucial for fostering a positive team dynamic and ensuring that every member's voice was heard.

As a result of the intervention meeting, the team members became more aware of the need for open communication and collaboration. By implementing regular meetings, we were able to allocate tasks more evenly and monitor the progress of each team member, leading to a more balanced distribution of responsibilities.

Moreover, the intervention meeting led to an increase in participation among team members. As we emphasized the value of each member's contributions, team members became more engaged and took a proactive approach to their tasks. This improved collaboration and encouraged team members to offer support and assistance when needed, resulting in a more cohesive and efficient working environment.

\section*{Justifications for unequal contributions}

Despite the intervention meeting's positive impact, some team members' engagement levels remained relatively low, particularly in terms of code updates (git commits) and task completion enthusiasm. These members did not actively participate in discussions or volunteer for tasks, leading to an imbalance in contributions.
