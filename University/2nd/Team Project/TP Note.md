## What is Usability

- Usability according to Wikipedia is the capacity of a system to allow users to perform tasks
  - safely,
  - effectively, and
  - efficiently
  - while enjoying the experience
  - Unfortunately,
    - Functionality is often easy to achieve
    - Making it usable is much harder

> - Example: Light switch
>   - Find it and switch the lights on(or off)
>   - safe: If there are no life wires!
>   - effective: Does it switch the light on/off?
>   - efficient: Can I find it in the dark?
>   - enjoyable: maybe if you have a dimmer
> - Just inserting a switch in a circuit is easy
> - But it is important to put it somewhere reachable, safe, operable by anyone regardless of size, strength, age, etc

- Traditionally Usability has been equated with Accessibility. In software it is an important concept for all.
  - effective: Is it serviceable for what I want to do?
  - efficient: Does it help me to do my task or does it get in the way?
  - enjoyable: The first two often define this!
  - safe: How severe are mistakes?
  - Additional aspects
    - learnability and memorability
      - Do I need a certificate to understand the software?
      - Do I have to relearn after not using a system for a while?

- A product should be usable by everyone regardless of age, disability or special needs
  - Particular aspect of Usability is Accessibility
  - Usability for one is unusablity for another
  - Try to find a common ground
  - General Principle of Universal Design

- A product and a process
  - Design that is usable by all people
    - Not always possible!
  - Design that works for as many people as possible
    - Design to extent the reach of your product to a wide audience
  - Design that has no need for adaptation
    - Do not design special cases, add-ons, extra layers, etc.

- Usability for users with special needs
  - **Visual**: blindness, low vision, impaired vision, distracted vision
  - **Aural**: deaf, hard of hearing, distracted hearing
  - **Movement**: limited use of extremities, slow reaction time, limited fine motor skills
  - **Cognition**: Dyslexia, Dyscalculia, Distraction, Memory deficits

- Is this not something for specialists only?
