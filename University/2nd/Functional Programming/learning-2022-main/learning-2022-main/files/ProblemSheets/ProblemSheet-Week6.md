# Problem Sheet for Week 6

## Complete all problem sheets for weeks 1-4

Please make sure you don't leave any problem unsolved. There are sample solutions, but it is better to attempt to solve the exercises yourself without consulting the sample solutions.

## Make sure you know how to run `presubmit`

Most of you succeeded, but a lot of you didn't. If your Practice Test submission didn't pass `presubmit`, make sure, in the lab session, that you modify it until you succeed. If you have difficulties, please ask a demonstrator in the lab.

## Make sure you run the automatic marking script

This will not only give you detailed feedback about your Practice Test submission, but will also tell you whether your submission comforms to the requirements.

The marks for Practice Test are now on Canvas and sample solutions have been released. Each question is worth 10 marks, and the total test is marked out of 50.

### Here are some important instructions, so please follow them carefully

Go to `learning-2022` in the terminal on Jupyter and update the repository by running `git pull`.

The sample solutions will now appear inside the folder files/Tests/PracticeTest/.

We expect that you re-run the marking script that we used on your solution, which will show you where you went right/wrong, and give you feedback:

 * Make sure that your file `PracticeTest.hs` is in the directory `PracticeTest`.

 * Do `runhaskell PracticeTestMarking.hs` to see your file getting marked.

### Penalties

* If your file did not pass the presubmit.sh script (e.g. it did not compile), then we could not mark your submission and therefore it received 0.1 marks.

* If your file did pass the presubmit.sh script, but you changed the module header (e.g. you removed something from module PracticeTest (...) where) then we could not mark your submission and therefore it received 0.2 marks.

* Lateness penalties and/or plagiarism penalties are going to be applied later, so your marks could change if you submitted late (not including extensions) or submitted work that was not your own.
