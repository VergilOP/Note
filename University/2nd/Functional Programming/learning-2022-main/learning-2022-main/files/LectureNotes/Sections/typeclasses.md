# Type classes and instances


* See the [prelude for the current version of the language](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.12.0.0/docs/Prelude.html) for all predefined classes and their instances.


## Introduction

**Video:** This introduction is also available as a [recording](https://bham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=0495c024-653b-48da-87df-ac3d0154eaf9).

We frequently want to check if two values in Haskell are equal.

**Observation:** We only want to compare two values **of the same type** for equality.
It does not make any sense to ask whether, e.g., a Boolean is equal to a character.

We would hence be tempted to write a **polymorphic function**
```hs
(==) : a -> a -> Bool
```
However, it is not always possible to decide if two values of a given type are equal.

**Exercise:** Find a type `a` whose values cannot be compared for equality with a Boolean function `a -> a -> Bool`.

(One such type is given in the video.)


The solution is given by **type classes**:
1. A **type class** is an interface for a set of operations on one (or more) types.
2. An **instance** of a type class is any type for which we have implemented the interface.

In Haskell, the operation `(==)` has the following type:
```hs
Prelude> :type (==)
(==) :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool
```
Here,
1. `Eq` is a **type class**, and
2. for any type `a` that is an **instance** of the type class `Eq`, `(==)` is a function of type `a -> a -> Bool` - but only for such `a`.
3. `Eq a` in `Eq a => a -> a -> Bool` is a **class constraint**:

**Exercise**

1. Run, and understand, the following examples:
    1. `False == 'c'`
    2. `False == True`
    3. `False == not`
    4. `False == not True`
    5. `not == id`
    6. `[not] == [ (id :: Bool -> Bool) ]`

**Explanation:** See the [video](https://bham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=d808dc3f-e37b-4e3a-8197-ac3d015b9ced).

For the example 6., Haskell understands that it should look for an instance of `Eq [Bool -> Bool]`. Since there is a generic instance `Eq a => Eq [a]`, Haskell proceeds to look for an instance of `Eq (Bool -> Bool)`. Alas, there is no such instance, as we know from example 5.

2. Explain, in your own words, why `(++)` does not require any class constraints, but `(==)` does.

## The type class `Eq`

**Video:** See [here](https://bham.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=02d9fdae-ae5f-4d3e-bf5e-ac3d0165178a).

We obtain information about the type class `Eq` as follows (some text is removed for legibility):
```hs
Prelude> :info Eq
class Eq a where
  (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
  (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
  {-# MINIMAL (==) | (/=) #-}
  	-- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’
instance (Eq a, Eq b) => Eq (Either a b)
  -- Defined in ‘Data.Either’
instance Eq a => Eq [a] -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’
instance Eq Word -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’
instance Eq Ordering -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’
instance Eq Int -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’
instance Eq Float -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’
instance Eq Double -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’
instance Eq Char -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’
instance Eq Bool -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’
...
instance (Eq a, Eq b, Eq c) => Eq (a, b, c)
  -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’
instance (Eq a, Eq b) => Eq (a, b) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’
instance Eq () -- Defined in ‘GHC.Classes’
instance Eq Integer
  -- Defined in ‘integer-gmp-1.0.2.0:GHC.Integer.Type’
instance Eq a => Eq (Maybe a) -- Defined in ‘GHC.Base’
```
This tells us the following:
1. The type class `Eq` provides two functions, `(==)` and `(/=)`.
2. To implement the type class on a type `a`, we have to implement at least one of `(==) :: a -> a -> Bool` or `(/=) :: a -> a -> Bool`.
3. Many instances of `Eq` are implemented, e.g., for `Word`, `Ordering`, `Int`,...
   Furthermore, we have **derived** instances:
   1. If types `a` and `b` are instances, then the type `(a,b)` of pairs of values in `a` and `b` is also an instance.
   2. Similarly, if `a` is an instance of `Eq`, so is the type `[a]` of lists of values in `a`.

Further information that is **not** printed above:
1. When only one of `(==)` and `(/=)` is provided by the user when implementing the instance, the other is defined automatically as its **negation**, e.g.,
   `x /= y = not (x == y)`.
2. The information does not say what the implementation of `(==)` is for any of the instances. This requires looking at the source code.


## Summary: type classes and instances

* A `class` in Haskell is like an interface in Java.

* We implement a class in Haskell using the keyword `instance`.

* Only types that are introduced using `data` or `newtype` can be made instances of classes (although GHC has some extensions to get around this...).

* It is only possible to declare a **single** instance of a class for any given `data` type or `newtype` (although GHC has some extensions to get around this...).

* In a function type, everything before `=>` is a **class constraint**: the function is only available for such types that are an instance of the mentioned classes.


## Inheritance: Extending a type class

Just like a Java interface can extend an interface, a type class can extend a type class.
Consider the following example:
```hs
Prelude> :i Ord
class Eq a => Ord a where
...
```
Here, the type class `Ord` (which we look at in detail below) extends the type class `Eq`. In other words, in order to turn a type `a` into an instance of `Ord`, we first need to turn it into an instance of `Eq`.
This will be studied in more detail later.

## Exercises:

1. Find all the basic instances of the type class `Bounded` that are defined in the GHC Prelude (the libraries that are loaded when starting `ghci`, without importing any additional libraries). Find out what `minBound` and `maxBound` are for each of the instances.
2. What type classes do the type classes `Fractional`, `Floating`, `Integral` extend? What functions do they provide? Which type class would you choose to implement a trigonometric calculus?
3. Another type class:
    1. Which type class defines the function `enumFromTo`?
    2. Evaluate `enumFromTo` on elements of each instance of that type class.
    3. Explain the different output between `:type enumFromTo 4 8` and `:type enumFromTo 4 (8 :: Int)`. If you are unsure about the answer, ask in the Teams chat.
4. Why does Haskell only allow **one** instance of any type class on a given type?
