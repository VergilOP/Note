# Working with the Jupyter Notebook 

We will be using the [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebook system
to write and run code interactively.

The School of Computer Science maintains its own instances which you
can connect to directly
[here](https://jupyter.apps.okd.aws.cs.bham.ac.uk).  (Note: this link
will become active just before the first lab session on Thursday, 30 Sep.)

Below are instructions for a few common tasks in order to get you started.

## Opening a Terminal

Under "Other", you will notice a button labelled *Terminal*.  Clicking this 
button will launch a Unix shell where you can enter commands, 

## Creating a New Source File

There are several methods to create a new text file:

1. Click the + button to open the launcher and then seles "Text File".
2. From the File menu, select New -> Text File
3. Right clicking in the file view brings up a context menu from which you can create a new file.
