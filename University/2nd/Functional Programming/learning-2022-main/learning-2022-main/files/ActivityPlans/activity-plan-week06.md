## Lab Session

 1. There is a revision lab session in your allocated time.
 1. Please complete *all* lab problem sheets.
 1. If your Practice Test submission didn't pass the `presubmit` script, make sure you modify it appropriately to make it to pass it. If you are in doubt, ask in the lab session.
