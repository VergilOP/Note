# Activity Plan for Week 5

There is also an [Activity Plan for Dubai Students](./activity-plan-week05-dubai.md).

## Summary

In Week 5 of the Functional Programming module, we will continue to study user defined data types. No new handouts will be given for this week.

## Lab Session

 1. There is no lab session on Tuesday.
 1. There is a drop-in lab session on Thursday 12:00-13:00 available to everybody, where questions about the test and the module can be asked, but no problem sheet will be given.

## Practice Test

 1. Tuesday 12:00-14:00.
 1. This is to be taken remotely, but you can use the lab provided there is enough space available.

## Before the Friday lecture

You must read Sections 1-4 of [User defined data types I](/files/LectureNotes/Sections/Data1.md) if you haven't done so already.

## After the Friday lecture

 4. You must read the remaining sections of [User defined data types I](/files/LectureNotes/Sections/Data1.md) if you haven't done so already.

 5. Read handout [lazy natural numbers](/files/LectureNotes/Sections/LazyNaturals.md), if you haven't done so already.

## Additional reading

 6. Chapter 8, "Declaring type and classes" of [Programming in Haskell](https://rl.talis.com/3/bham/lists/C9A9B3B5-0505-08C0-23A3-2A6A14A3CB1E.html?lang=en).
