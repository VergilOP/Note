# Activity Plan for Week 10

There is also an [Activity Plan for Dubai Students](./activity-plan-week10-dubai.md).

## Summary

This week we will put together everything we learned so far in the module by developing an interpreter for a small imperative language. This will use monads for parsing programs and for doing IO. After parsing a program, we will obtain a syntax tree representation of the program. To run the program, we use a recursive definition of tress.

## Work on your homework

Work on your homework available on Canvas. This is not assessed but mandatory, and crucial to perform well in the second class test.

## Lab Session

We strongly recommend that you attend you lab session this week, where we will have exercises on monads.

 1. The labs sessions will be on Tue only. If you session is on Thursday, please choose a slot in one (or more) of the Tuesday 12:00-15:00 sessions.

 2. The Thursday lab slot is for 1-1 help on any topic of the module. (You can also ask questions about any topic of the module on Tuesday.)

 3. Work on the [homework for week 10](/files/ProblemSheets/ProblemSheet-Week10.md) to be completed by Monday of Week 11. This will not be marked, but sample solutions are provided.

## Before the Friday lecture

 4. Read the handouts from [Interpreter](/files/LectureNotes/Sections/interpreter/README.md).
