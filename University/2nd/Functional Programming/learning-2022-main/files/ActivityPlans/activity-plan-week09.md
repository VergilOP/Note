# Activity Plan for Week 9

There is also an [Activity Plan for Dubai Students](./activity-plan-week09-dubai.md).

## Summary

In Week 8 of the Functional Programming module, we studied how to *use* monads. In Week 9 we study *how they work*.

## Work on your homework

Work on your homework available on Canvas. This is not assessed but mandatory, and crucial to perform well in the second class test.

## Lab Session

We strongly recommend that you attend you lab session this week,

 1. The sections of [Monads](/files/LectureNotes/Sections/monads.md) **preceding** *What monads are, and how to define new ones*.
 2. Work on the [homework for week 9](https://git.cs.bham.ac.uk/fp/learning-2022/-/tree/main/files/ProblemSheets/Homework9) to be returned on Monday of Week 10.

## Before the Friday lecture

 3. Read *What monads are, and how to define new ones* from [Monads](/files/LectureNotes/Sections/monads.md).

## After the Friday lecture

 4. You must study the remaining sections of the above handout on monads.

## Additional reading

 5. Chapter 12, "Monads and more" of [Programming in Haskell](https://rl.talis.com/3/bham/lists/C9A9B3B5-0505-08C0-23A3-2A6A14A3CB1E.html?lang=en).
