# Activity Plan for Week 1
[Activity Plan for Dubai Students](./activity-plan-week01-dubai.md)

 0. Read [Important module information](https://git.cs.bham.ac.uk/fp/learning-2022/-/blob/main/README.md)

## Summary

In Week 1 of the Functional Programming module, we will:

 1. Have a general overview of the module with the Game of Life.

 2. Study types.

 3. Study polymorphism.

## Lab Session: how to prepare

 4. Check on Canvas which lab session you have been allocated to.

The first lab session doesn't require any preparation, but here is the problem sheet we will use if you want to look at it in advance:

 5. [Lab 1 problem sheet](../ProblemSheets/ProblemSheet-Week1.md)

Each lab session will start with a 10 minute explanation of the activities you have to perform in the lab. There will be demonstrators to help you.

## Activities **before** the in-person lecture

 6. Read handout [Introduction to Haskell - Conway's Game of Life](../LectureNotes/Sections/Life.md).

## Activities **after** the in-person lecture

 7. Read handout - [Types in Haskell](../LectureNotes/Sections/types.md)

 8. Read handout - [Polymorphism](../LectureNotes/Sections/polymorphism.md)

## Additional material

 9.
