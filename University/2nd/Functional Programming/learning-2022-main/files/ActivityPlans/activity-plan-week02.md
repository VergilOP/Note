# Activity Plan for Week 2
[Activity Plan for Dubai Students](./activity-plan-week02-dubai.md)

## Summary

In Week 2 of the Functional Programming module, we will:

 * Study the basic Type Classes and Instances.

 * Understand different ways of writing Functions (composing, guarded equations, pattern matching, and lambda  expressions).

 * Look at Operators and Sections: ways to turn infix function symbols into functions.

 * Apply our knowledge on functions when learning a bit more on Type Classes.

## Online Lab Session: how to prepare

You must:

 1. Make sure you have done the [problem sheet for Week 1](../ProblemSheets/ProblemSheet-Week1.md).

 2. Make sure you have done all the [required reading for Week 1](../ActivityPlans/activity-plan-week01.md).

## Before the Friday lecture

You must read the following handouts:

 3. Handout - [Type Classes and Instances](../LectureNotes/Sections/typeclasses.md)

 4. Handout - [Functions](../LectureNotes/Sections/functions.md)

## After the Friday lecture

You must read the following handouts:

 5. Handout - [More on Type Classes](../LectureNotes/Sections/more-typeclasses.md)

 6. Handout - [Even more about type classes](../LectureNotes/Sections/even-more-typeclasses.md)

## Optional additional reading

If you think the above are not enough for you to understand or you want to learn more:
